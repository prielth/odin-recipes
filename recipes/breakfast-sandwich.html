    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tall burger bun</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>2 slices mortadella, sliced Â¼ inch thick</li>
      <li>
        1 slice american cheese *note you can just pick one cheese or do both*
      </li>
      <li>1 slice provolone *note you can just pick one cheese or do both*</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>Softened unsalted butter for cooking</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Begin by preparing the bun by cutting it in half and trimming the domed
        part of the top bun so that it is the same height as the bottom bun.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare the eggs by whisking together until homogenous, then seasoning
        with salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a medium saute pan over medium heat. Once hot add mortadella to the
        pan. Sear each side for about 1-2 minutes. Repeat this step for all
        mortadella.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the mortadella has been cooked, add the eggs to the pan, stirring
        to break up the curd that is forming.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the egg is beginning to set, add a slice of provolone into the
        middle of the cheese. Then fold in the sides to create a square pocket
        that the provolone is in.
      </li>
      <li>Once the egg is cooked, begin to toast buttered buns in the pan.</li>
      <li>
        When the top bun is toasted, flip it over and begin to assemble the
        sandwich in the pan by placing a slice of american cheese onto the bun.
      </li>
      <li>
        Top the american cheese with the egg, then add the mortadella over the
        egg.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finish by adding the top and allow the sandwich to cook in the pan for 1
        additional minute.
      </li>
      <li>Serve and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
